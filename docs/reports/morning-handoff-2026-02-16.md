# Morning Handoff — 2026-02-16

## What I did
1. Monitored parity progress and took over stalled work.
2. Committed and pushed pending Batch 3 work to `main`:
   - `a852035` feat: batch 3 parity updates for Portal Settings, LMS Connect, and Library
3. Created a remediation branch for safe follow-up:
   - `qa/remediation-report-and-tests`
4. Implemented quality hardening and test foundation on branch.
5. Produced three analysis reports plus remediation plan.

## Outcomes
### Successes
- Build remains passing.
- Lint now passes on remediation branch.
- Baseline automated tests introduced and passing.
- Clear QA/architecture/ops reports created.

### Failures / Shortfalls
- Full-site parity is not complete yet.
- E2E automation is not yet in place.
- Workflow-heavy areas (IDM) still require deeper parity pass.

### Blockers encountered
- Overnight parity run stalled (no new writes for ~4 hours).
- Dual local repo paths caused confusion earlier; resolved by operating in `/Users/tomleger/repo/principaljonessimulator` (District Simulator).

## Current status
- `main` includes parity work through Batch 3 (`a852035`).
- Remediation and tests are on branch `qa/remediation-report-and-tests` (not merged).

## Next steps (ordered)
1. Review and merge remediation branch after approval.
2. Add Playwright smoke tests.
3. Add CI gate for lint/test/build.
4. Continue parity batches with strict evidence artifacts.
