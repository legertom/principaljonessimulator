# QA Report — 2026-02-16

## Scope
- Reviewed current parity work through Batch 3
- Validated build, lint, and baseline tests
- Checked critical simulator flows for structural correctness

## Validation Results
- `npm run build` ✅ pass
- `npm run lint` ✅ pass
- `npm test` ✅ pass (6 tests)

## Functional Findings
### Passing
1. Portal lobby is now the entrypoint after auth.
2. Portal ➜ dashboard transition exists (`onLaunchApp` mapping).
3. Dashboard ➜ portal return path exists (TopNav portal button).
4. Batch 2 and Batch 3 parity updates are present in target pages.

### Risks / Gaps
1. Evidence discipline is mixed: some audit screenshots are references, not always stored assets.
2. Workflow parity is still uneven for modal-heavy flows (IDM and advanced admin operations).
3. No full E2E regression harness yet (only new unit-level baseline tests).

## Quality Assessment
- **UI parity trajectory:** improving, not complete.
- **Code health trajectory:** improved (lint clean now).
- **Release confidence:** medium for supervised internal training use.

## Recommendations
1. Add Playwright smoke E2E for core flows.
2. Require local evidence files for every parity claim.
3. Prioritize IDM workflow map + implementation before declaring full parity.
