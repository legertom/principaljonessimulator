/**
 * Course and module definitions for the Help Desk Training Simulator.
 *
 * This is the top-level organizational layer that sits above scenarios.
 * It groups scenario IDs into pedagogical modules, defines prerequisites,
 * and provides the boss character's intro/completion messages.
 *
 * DESIGN DECISION — Module 1 covers all four IDM tabs:
 * The tabs (Tasks, Sync History, Exports, Events) show the *output* of IDM —
 * what happened during syncs, what issues exist, what data can be exported.
 * Teaching "reading comprehension" before "writing" gives learners a mental
 * model of what the system *does* before they learn to *configure* it.
